# RankGun Ranking Centre 

This is the rankgun ranking centre which is designed to interact with the RankGun API made using [rojo](https://rojo.space/), [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/docs/quick-start), [roblox-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rbxts/react) and more.

The RankGun ranking centre allows group roles to be awarded in turn for a roblox product sale. 

Please keep in mind this software is avaible for everyone under the [RankGun PolyForm Shield License](/license.md).

## Development

1. Make sure ESLint is installed.
2. Make suer prettier is installed.
3. Ensure rojo and roblox-ts are installed.
4. Run watch mode: ``npx rbxtsc -w``
5. In another terminal, run ``rojo serve`` to start Rojo.

You may want to have [Ui Labs](https://pepeeltoro41.github.io/ui-labs/) installed in order to preview the UI.
